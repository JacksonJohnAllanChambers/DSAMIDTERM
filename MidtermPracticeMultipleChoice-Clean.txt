8. Consider the following class declaration

private double num2; 
//rest of the code omitted 

} 
 
Another class MyDemo has a main method which instantiates two objects of type MyClass. Which of 
the following statements is correct?

For questions 9, 10 and 11, use the code below: 
Consider a class to represent a Pokemon card. It has partial code given below:

//healthpoints). There is also a static variable price that represents the price of the Pokemon card. 
public class Pokemon{ 

private String name; 
private int hp; 
private static double price; 
//rest of the code missing 

}
